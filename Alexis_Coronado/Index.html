                <h2>Story</h2>
                <p>The story of Jujutsu Kaisen is set in a world where Cursed Spirits feed on unsuspecting humans and fragments of the legendary and feared demon Ryomen Sukuna have been lost and scattered about.</p>
                <p>Should any curse consume Sukuna's body parts, the power they gain could destroy the world as we know it. Fortunately, there exists a mysterious school of Jujutsu Sorcerers who exist to protect the precarious existence of the living from the supernatural</p>

                <h2>Cursed Spirit</h2>
                <p>Cursed Spirits (呪じゅ霊れい Jurei?), or simply Curses (呪のろい Noroi?), are a race of spiritual beings invisible to humans, incarnated from the cursed energy that leaks out of humans over time due to their negative emotions. Cursed spirits haunt and bring harm to humanity and are consequently the primary targets of jujutsu sorcerers and their exorcist work.</p>
                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The origin of curses and jujutsu is largely unknown. However, it can be surmised that because cursed energy comes from negative emotion, curses have always existed alongside humanity. During the Heian Era, the golden age of jujutsu, the sorcerer Ryomen Sukuna was recognized as the undisputed King of Curses. His influence has lived on to greatly affect the current age.

                    In the modern-day, the number of unexplained deaths and disappearances in Japan exceeds ten thousand annually. These statistics are a direct result of the influence that curses have on normal society. Their existence has been kept secret from non-sorcerers, as they are invisible to them. Jujutsu sorcerers act in secret to repel the threat of curses.
                    
                    Starting in 2017, the year the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons occurred, curse-related events have begun to happen more frequently while presenting more danger than ever before. This includes Sukuna's reincarnation as well as the unregistered appearance of over four new special grade cursed spirits in Mahito's group.</p>
